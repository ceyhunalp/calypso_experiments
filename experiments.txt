=============== CENTRALIZED CALYPSO ==============
CreateWriteData
(1) Generate symkey
(2) symenc data
(3) elgamal encrypt the symkey

CreateWriteTxn
(1) Contact the centralized server
(2) log write request to boltDB

CreateReadTxn
(1) Contact the centralized server
(2) check that the read request points at the correct write request
(3) verify signature with the pk in the read policy
(4) elgamal decrypt the symkey
(5) elgamal encrypt the symkey

RecoverData
(1) Elgamal decrypt the symkey
(2) Symdec to recover data

=============== SIMPLE CALYPSO ==============
SetupDarc
(1) Create key pairs
(2) Define DARC rules

SpawnDarc 
(1) Add txn to Byzcoin

CreateWriteData
>> same as before <<

StoreEncryptedData
(1) Log encrypted data at the centralized storage

AddWriteTransaction
(1) Add transaction to Byzcoin

GetProof

AddReadTransaction
(1) Add transaction to Byzcoin

GetProof

DecryptRequest
(1) Read points to the correct write
(2) write and read proof verifies
(3) symdec to see if reader ok
(4) verify signature
(5) elgamal decrypt
(6) Also verify that the reader has the key that was encrypted with the symkey

RecoverData
>> same as before <<
